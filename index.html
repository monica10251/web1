<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>
It is an information retrieval system that can retrieve information on the Internet in hypertext or multimedia environment. It is the most widely used system in the world to effectively search for various information on the Internet in hypertext format.Hypertext can be seen as a program called a Web browser that reads information fragments such as files and web pages from a Web server and outputs them to a computer monitor. Users can then follow hyperlinks on each page to move to another document or send a set of information to the server serving the page.<img src="coding4.jpg" width=80%> The act of moving along hyperlinks is called web surfing or web browsing. A collection of related websites is called a website.The English word "worldwide" is usually used as a word without spaces or hyphens, but the World Wide Web and its abbreviation "WWW" are used as official English words.The World Wide Web can be summarized into three functions: First, a unified method of locating Web resources, such as URLs.Second, protocols that access Web resource names, such as HTTP, and third, languages that allow easy navigation between resources, such as HTML.[3]
