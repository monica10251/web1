<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>
Cascading Style Sheets are mainly used in HTML and XHTML, style languages that describe how markup languages are actually displayed, and can also be used in XML. Standard for basic file name W3C, with high freedom in defining layouts and styles.The basic file name is style.css. If the markup language is responsible for the main body of a website, CSS can be used to decorate it like clothes or accessories, meaning that HTML structures can be left intact and just by modifying CSS files, it can look like a completely different website. For CSS3, which is currently being developed, features such as shadow effects, gradation, and deformation have been added to replace images produced by graphic editing programs. Various animation features have also been added to replace Adobe Flash to some extent.<img src="coding2.jpg" width=80%></p>
