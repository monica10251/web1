<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript is an object-based script programming language. This language is mainly used in Web browsers and has access to built-in objects in other applications. It is also used for server programming, such as runtime environments such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation under the name of Mocha and later LiveScript, and eventually JavaScript. JavaScript is similar in syntax to Sun Microsystems' Java, because both languages are based on the basic syntax of C, so Java and JavaScript are not directly related. In addition to names and syntax, there are more similarities to self-help and schemes than to Java. JavaScript is recognized as the language that best implements the standard specification of ECMAScript (ECMAScript), which is supported by most browsers until ECMAScript 5 (ES5), but has been compiled into a browser-compatible version since ECMAScript 6.<img src="coding3.jpg" width=80%></p>
